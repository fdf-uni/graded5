# graded5

This repository contains my solution to the fifth graded exercise sheet of the "Advanced Statistical Programming using R" course at LMU Munich.
Please note that the credit for the main idea as well as for some parts of the code entirely goes to the lecture team which were kind enough to let me upload my solution to GitHub.

If you want to see the app in action, you can try it out at the link in the repository's description.

The app was rendered using [r-shinylive](https://posit-dev.github.io/r-shinylive/) and deployed to GitHub via GitHub Pages.
I recommend [this guide](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/shinylive-r) if you want to do something similar. :)
